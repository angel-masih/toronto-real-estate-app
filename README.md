Toronto Real Estate App

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is a personal project Iâ€™m working on â€” a real estate app made for people looking to rent or buy places in the Toronto/GTA area. It's kind of like StreetEasy, but local to where I live.

## ðŸš§ What I'm Working On
Right now, Iâ€™m still building out the basics. Iâ€™m using React Native to make it mobile-first, and Firebase for things like user login, saving listings, and storing data.

## ðŸ›  Tech Iâ€™m Using
- React Native (with Expo)
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- Google Maps API
- Node.js (for backend logic later)

## âœ¨ Features I'm Adding
- Search for listings by map or list view
- Filter by price, location, number of bedrooms, etc.
- Save your favorite places
- Login and signup with Firebase

## ðŸ—‚ Project Layout (So Far)
```
/toronto-real-estate-app
â”œâ”€â”€ /assets
â”œâ”€â”€ /components
â”œâ”€â”€ /screens
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js
â”œâ”€â”€ firebaseConfig.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## ðŸ”œ Coming Later
- Landlords can post listings
- Messaging feature for renters & landlords
- Push notifications when new listings match your filters
