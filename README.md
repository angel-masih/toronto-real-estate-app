Toronto Real Estate App

Hey there. This is a personal project I’m working on — a real estate app made for people looking to rent or buy places in the Toronto/GTA area. It's kind of like StreetEasy, but local to where I live.

## Working On
Right now, I’m still building out the basics. I’m using React Native to make it mobile-first, and Firebase for things like user login, saving listings, and storing data.

## Using
- React Native (with Expo)
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- Google Maps API
- Node.js (for backend logic later)

## Features
- Search for listings by map or list view
- Filter by price, location, number of bedrooms, etc.
- Save your favorite places
- Login and signup with Firebase

## Project Layout
```

## to do
- Landlords can post listings
- Messaging feature for renters & landlords
- Push notifications when new listings match your filters
